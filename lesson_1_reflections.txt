This is my reflections of using a version control system

The question was:
How did viewing a diff between two versionof a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Diff focused the search between the old and new files to those llines, and the code before an after, that had changed.



Next Question:
Having a history of the files allows a reviewer to see the progrssion of the file and see where new features are added.

Manual Commits:
Are great when you hit the logical end of a change or addition.  Too big and you loose resolution, too small it becomes cluttered.

git log is used to see commit comments and commit ID

git diff can be used on two commits to see the changes.  Use the time tag to differntiate.

I want to use Git to manage code changes while developing software projects.
