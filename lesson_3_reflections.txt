Manual vx. automatic pull
Just like commiting to a local repository, pulls should be manual so that code is not changed locally due to a change on the remote. If the code is out of sync, it could break your local code.


Forks, Clones and Branches
Forks leverage the code of another as a starting point for your own work. This is a GitHub unique feature. Clones copy a repository locally. Branches can be used to develop a feature

Last known state
By having the last known state of the remote stored locally, the developer can see a clean baseline of the code. This woudl be ideal if internet is not avaiable for a period of time and development can continue.
