When an repository is initialized a .git file is created which will be used to keep infomration about the respository.  No files are automatically added.

The staging area is a temporary holding zone where changes can be collected to be commited in one action to complete a logical change. This is a way to collect individual changes into one logical change.

The staging area can bin up one logical change and do one commit.  Then additional chagnes can be added to the next commit.

Branches allow a parallel development path to try new features or fixes without riskign the main code respository.`

The visualizaiton diagram give a graphical representation of branches and where the master is located.


The two branches are parallel paths joined into one, merging the additions of two branches into one new master.
